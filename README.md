# Steam Account Finder
Original program made by Zute/Ezzpify  
Forked and edited by matthewwc

This will find Steam accounts within the given id range that has not yet set up their steam community profiles. This usually means that the account is inactive and up for grabs. :-)

Since Hotmail purged a lot of the inactive emails, you can simply create a new email with the same email as the account name and recover the password for the steam account that way.

Credits for the original idea goes to lukeryuri/phoenixdoom. ~~They have their own project that I recommend you also check out! github link was unrelated to phoenixdoom~~
